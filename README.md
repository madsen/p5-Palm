p5-Palm
=======

p5-Palm is a a set of Perl 5 modules for reading, manipulating, and writing the .pdb and .prc database files used by Palm OS devices such as the PalmPilot and its successors.

You'll also need the [Palm::PDB](https://metacpan.org/pod/Palm::PDB) and [Palm::Raw](https://metacpan.org/pod/Palm::Raw) modules.  They used to be distributed as part of p5-Palm, but were split out into their own distribution because they are also useful for manipulating the Mobipocket e-book format, which is also used for Amazon Kindle books. The modules remaining in p5-Palm are generally useful only if you're dealing with files from actual Palm OS devices.

This is a Git repository where development of p5-Palm takes place.  For more information, visit [p5-Palm on CPAN](http://metacpan.org/release/Palm).
